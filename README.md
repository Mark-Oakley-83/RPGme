I want to create a game where people create a character based on themselves. The Character grows with the player and real-world improvements improve your character. The Character can be played in a TTRPG style game (with an in-app game to follow eventually) that can take place in several different eras, such as wild west, colonial times, or even several versions of the future, to see how you might survive in these eras. The games can be as true to life or fantastic as the storyteller (game master) wants it to be to test their player’s characters' real-world skills in a fantasy land. Rules for world-building will be various expansions later.
